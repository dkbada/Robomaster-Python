## Box Push Algorithm
This algorithm utilizes two robots that detect a box through their cameras and push the box together toward a randomly located goal. 
The two robots run under the same code -- this is done by adding the computing device and robots to the same LAN. Threading the two robots through Python, they execute the same algorithm to stream camera, detect, and push the box to a goal.
